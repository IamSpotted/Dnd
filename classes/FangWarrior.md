## Design Notes

The Fang Warrior was designed to:
- Embrace the Sher's quadrupedal and natural weapon identity
- Maintain a smooth, scalable damage curve
- Compete with martial classes without overshadowing them
- Prioritize mobility, ferocity, and natural instincts over brute efficiency

Compared to Fighters:
- **Lower sustained DPR**, especially at higher levels
- **Much higher burst potential** using Tiger’s Fury
- **Superior mobility and battlefield control**, including leaping, pouncing, and movement after kills

The 20th-level weapon damage boost was reduced (2d8 → 2d6 claws, 2d10 → 2d8 bite) to keep DPR in line with Fighters.
Tiger's Fury increases the damage to 2d8 bite and 2d6 Claws when activated. Giving a boost to spike damage.

**Note**: Designed exclusively for the Sher race. Requires DM approval.
